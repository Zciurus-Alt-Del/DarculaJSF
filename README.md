# DarculaJSF

This is a copy of Pycharm's "Darcula" color scheme as a .jsf file. I made this to be used with the [NiceEditor](https://github.com/vigna/ne), although the file format originates from [Joe's  Own Editor](https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/).
Additionally to adjusting the colors, I added the Builtin-functions as a new category of keywords for seperate highliting.

# How to use
Download the file `python.jsf` from this repository and copy it into the syntax folder, overwriting the default `python.jsf` file. 
By default this path is `/usr/share/ne/syntax/`.
